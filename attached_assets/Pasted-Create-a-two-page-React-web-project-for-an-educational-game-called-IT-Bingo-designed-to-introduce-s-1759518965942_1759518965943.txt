Create a two-page React web project for an educational game called IT Bingo, designed to introduce students to different IT study fields at VOCO (Tartu Vocational College).

👉 Important:

The entire project must be frontend-only.

No databases, no backend – all data must be stored in JavaScript objects/arrays in the frontend.

Must include responsive design for both mobile and desktop screens.

Use React + TailwindCSS for UI and styling.

Use lightweight animation (Anime.js, GSAP, or CSS animations) for effects.

📄 Page 1: Home Page

Minimalistic modern design inspired by VOCO branding.

Display the VOCO logo.

Three main buttons:

Play → navigates to the Bingo game page.

Video → opens a popup modal with an embedded YouTube video.

About Us → opens a popup modal with a short description of VOCO.

🎮 Page 2: Game Page (IT Bingo)

Each column contains 5 subjects, represented by icons instead of text.

Hovering over an icon → shows subject name (tooltip).

Clicking an icon → opens a popup card with:

Field name

Short subject description

One question with 3 multiple-choice answers

“Bing” sound effect when opening

✅ Answer logic:

Correct → icon square turns green + “ding” sound.

Wrong → icon square turns red + “buzz” sound.

When all 5 subjects in a column are answered correctly:

Display “BINGO – Your best matching study field is [FIELD NAME]!”

Trigger fireworks animation + celebratory sound effect.
